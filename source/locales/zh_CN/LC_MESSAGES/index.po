"COBRA would be an excellent TF targets hunter based on its highly "
"developed sense of smell for ChIP-seq and excellent sense of touch for "
"RNA-seq. However, this is also a greedy snake. In order to let COBRA "
"become your reliable partener, we highly recommond to feed at least 20 "
"ChIP-seq experiments for it. Once COBRA gets enough feeds from users, it "
"could do some cool stuffs, like dotplot painting. Why not have one "
"yourself? Check this page out to see how it works now!"

"相传，python家族里有一只灵蛇COBRA，潜心修炼，这不在这纷乱的2020年年末，赶上末班车收录进了SS-ZOO。COBRA凭借自己在蛇类特有的敏锐的RNA-seq嗅觉以及ChIP-seq触感取得了TF基因捕猎者的称号。对地球上的生物学家来说，TF目标基因的寻找一直是一个严峻的挑战，这么久以来，神通广大的科学家们用尽招数对它进行寻找和研究，研发出了诸如BETA和RCade等一系列工具，但是效果有时候还是不尽人意。为了提高搜寻效果，COBRA利用现有的机器学习理论，配合DBSCAN以及Gaussian Mixture Model，贪婪地吸取利用着着用户提供的每一组ChIP-seq实验数据，和RNA-seq数据，相信有了COBRA的陪伴，你在目标基因寻找中的旅途将不再孤单！如果你也有心寻找挖掘TF目标基因的宝藏，为什么不来这里领用一只属于你的COBRA呢？相信它能够成为一只你科研旅途中强有力的引路蛇！"
