"COBRA would be an excellent TF targets hunter based on its highly "
"developed sense of smell for ChIP-seq and excellent sense of touch for "
"RNA-seq. However, this is also a greedy snake. In order to let COBRA "
"become your reliable partener, we highly recommond to feed at least 20 "
"ChIP-seq experiments for it. Once COBRA gets enough feeds from users, it "
"could do some cool stuffs, like dotplot painting. Why not have one "
"yourself? Check this page out to see how it works now!"
msgstr "COBRA是一个优秀的TF目标基因猎手，凭借其蛇类出色的ChIP-seq嗅觉，以及RNA-seq触觉，在此领域独当一面。然而，它也有自己的缺点，和贪吃蛇一样，它也很贪心。所以，要使得COBRA变得靠谱，你必须投喂至少20个ChIP-seq实验。一旦得到了足够的喂投，COBRA可以开始做一些有趣的事情，比如绘图。是不是很有意思的一条蛇，领它！"
