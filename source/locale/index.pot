msgid "COBRA would be an excellent TF targets hunter based on its highly developed sense of smell for ChIP-seq and excellent sense of touch for RNA-seq. However, this is also a greedy snake. In order to let COBRA become your reliable partener, we highly recommond to feed at least 20 ChIP-seq experiments for it. Once COBRA gets enough feeds from users, it could do some cool stuffs, like dotplot painting. Why not have one yourself? Check this page out to see how it works now!"
